# Algorithmic Toolbox - Coursera

This repo contains my solutions to the challenges given in the course in Java Programming Language.

Instead of using multiple directories which I should have, I have gone with a different approach by naming the files according to their week in course.

Therefore files starting with W1 are from Week 1, W2 from Week 2 and so on.

### Legend :
* **W1 - Programming Challenges**
  1. Sum of Two Digits
  1. Maximum Pairwise Product
* **W2 - Algorithmic Warmup**
  1. Fibonacci Number
  1. Last Digit of Fibonacci Number
  1. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
  1. Least Common Multiple (LCM)
  1. Fibonacci Number Again
  1. Last Digit of Sum of Fibonacci Numbers
  1. Last Digit of Sum of Fibonacci Numbers Again
  1. Last Digit of The Sum of Squares of Fibonacci Numbers
* **W3 - Greedy Algorithms**
  1. Money Change
  1. Maximum Value of The Loot
  1. Car Fueling
  1. Maximum Advertisement Revenue
  1. Collecting Signatures
  1. Maximum Number of Prizes
  1. Maximum Salary
* **W4 - Divide and Conquer**
  1. Binary Search
  1. Majority Element
  1. Improving Quicksort
  1. Number of Inversions
  1. Organizing a Lottery
  1. Closest Points
* **W5 - Dynamic Programming 1**
  1. Money Change Again
  1. Primitive Calculator
  1. Edit Distance
  1. Longest Common Subsequence of Two Sequences
  1. Longest Common Subsequence of Three Sequences
* **W6 - Dynamic Programming 2**
  1. Maximum Amount of Gold
  1. Partitioning Souvenirs
  1. Maximum Value of an Arithmetic Expression

*A pdf is also attached which explains the approches taken and also explains the problems in detail*
